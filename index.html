<h5 id="about-text"><br>We are a team of 45 passionate and innovative students in a student engineering project based out of Manipal, Karnataka, that strives to design, conceptualise, fabricate, test, and race a single-seater open-wheel Formula-style race car. Since the beginning of FORMULA MANIPAL in 2007, our team has created 14 remarkably engineered vehicles that have led us to win countless awards in events both in India, like Formula Bharat and competitions around the world, including ones that take place in Italy, Germany, Austria, The Czech Republic, and the United Kingdom.

  Our motto, "Engineered with Passion", pushes us to improve our performance year after year, each year, to produce better, more efficient, and more powerful cars that can take this team to greater heights. This year marks 17 years of our beautiful legacy. Stick around to watch us FLY!!</h5>
